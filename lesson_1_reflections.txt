this was a really difficult lesson
how many characters are in this line?
the instructions say that we should limit the lines to between 80 and 120 characters
I wonder how many characters each of these lines have?

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer?
Because you'd have a better sense of the fact that you're writing this code for future generations.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual Commit pros: you can be very clear about what was changed. 
Manual Commit Cons: you have to make a decision about when to commit - and maybe 
you have to debug a whole bunch of things at once so it's hard.  

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git needs to have systems to save multiple files because those multiple files work together. 
Google docs are often dealing with stand-alone files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
type "git log" and then scroll through the commits with down arrow, when you're done, press Q

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because you have the confidence of knowing that you can always go back to a version that was working

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would like to try to run a simple program and then see what happens.
